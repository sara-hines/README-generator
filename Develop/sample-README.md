# Work Day Planner | Local Storage & Third Party APIs

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This Work Day Planner app uses local storage, jQuery, Day.js, Bootstrap, and of course, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to provide a convenient way to schedule and save events for a 9am - 5pm work day. During the creation of this project, it was evident how useful libraries, third party APIs, CSS frameworks, and other tools can be for simplifying tasks and accessing rich resources which would otherwise be unavailable.<br/><br/>As I expand my toolset and building upon my skills in development, I am learning to approach problems from different angles, and am using objects, functions, event listeners, and even unassuming string methods in new ways. Different applications of local storage are also proving to be opportunities for better understanding JavaScript functions. This work day planner has helped further my understanding of appropriate scenarios for passing a function, calling a function, passing a parameter to a function, and passing a function as a parameter to another function.<br/><br/>The most important feature of this particular app is its relavence and usefulness for everyday life. The product of incorporating quite a few tools and libraries is a calendar which: dynamically displays the current date; color codes hours of the workday based on whether they have passed, are the current hour, or are in the future; and allows the user to input, save, and view their own events for each hour of the day. Since calendar apps are so widely and so often used throughout the day, it is a very relavent skill to be able to replicate and build upon the functionality of a basic workday calendar.

## Installation

No installation is required to use this application. 

## Usage

When the user navigates to the application at https://sara-hines.github.io/work-day-planner, they will see a calendar with the title "Work Day Planner," the current date displayed under the subheading "A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day," and a work day calendar with one section (or, time block, as it will be referred to going forward) for each of the hours from 9am through 5pm. To enter and save an event, click inside the time block for the hour of the event, type the text for the event, and click the blue save button to the right of the time block. The event will persist in local storage so that the user can navigate elsewhere in the browser and view their saved events again when returning to the calendar. 

## Features

To further explain and explore the functionality of this work day planner, the features will be depicted through images and GIFs.<br/><br/>Upon navigating to the site for the first time, the calendar will have an appearance similar to the below.<br/><br/>![img1](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/bfa150d5-f1c7-4c22-8fe2-8d9c163083bf)<br/><br/>When the user enters text inside a time block and hovers over the save button to the right of the time block, the save icon inside the save button enlarges and darkens. This visual cue, depicted on the 9am save button in the below screenshot, helps to guide the user interaction.<br/><br/>![img2](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/d560f1e8-7e5c-4ae0-8b72-9daa50f2216b)<br/><br/>When the user enters text and clicks the save button, the message, "Appointment added to local storage âœ…" will briefly appear just under the displayed date, as in the below screenshot.<br/><br/>![img3](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/467f2ba6-a760-492c-a9f4-82abab9a999f)<br/><br/>If the user refreshes the page, leaves the page, or closes the browser, upon returning, the saved events will still be displayed on the calendar. Depending on the current hour of the day, time blocks which have passed will have a grey background color, the current hour will have a red background color, and future time blocks will have a green background color. An example of saved events, with color coding assuming that the current hour is 12pm, can be viewed below.<br/><br/>![img4](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/52922787-3907-4e82-8dd2-4dbf9de649a6)

## Credits

Many thanks to my instructor Stephen Woosley and teaching assistant Nick S., who helped to troubleshoot issues I was having with causing local storage persist, and guided the use of a string method where I hadn't considered how helpful it would be. They also helped me to start using bracket notation to work with object key value pairs in a dynamic way. I so appreciate Stephen and Nick's guidance!<br/><br/>Squash Labs. (2023, October 13).

Crowder's Aug 15, 2017 suggestion to use event.currentTarget instead of event.target to prevent child elements from being the target when parent element is clicked. I used this for the \<button> elements with the \<i> elements within which were sometimes becoming event.target.)
