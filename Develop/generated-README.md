## Description

This Work Day Planner app uses local storage, jQuery, Day.js, Bootstrap, and of course, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to provide a convenient way to schedule and save events for a 9am - 5pm work day. During the creation of this project, it was evident how useful libraries, third party APIs, CSS frameworks, and other tools can be for simplifying tasks and accessing rich resources which would otherwise be unavailable.<br/><br/>As I expand my toolset and building upon my skills in development, I am learning to approach problems from different angles, and am using objects, functions, event listeners, and even unassuming string methods in new ways. Different applications of local storage are also proving to be opportunities for better understanding JavaScript functions. This work day planner has helped further my understanding of appropriate scenarios for passing a function, calling a function, passing a parameter to a function, and passing a function as a parameter to another function.<br/><br/>The most important feature of this particular app is its relavence and usefulness for everyday life. The product of incorporating quite a few tools and libraries is a calendar which: dynamically displays the current date; color codes hours of the workday based on whether they have passed, are the current hour, or are in the future; and allows the user to input, save, and view their own events for each hour of the day. Since calendar apps are so widely and so often used throughout the day, it is a very relavent skill to be able to replicate and build upon the functionality of a basic workday calendar.
